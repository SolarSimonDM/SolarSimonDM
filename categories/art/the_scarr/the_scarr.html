            <p class="solarparagraph_center solarparagraph_text_align_center">We were younglings, fools of our modern image. We were having a fun, yet competitive game of tag, which resulted in a tie between Reggie from Junior's and Margaret Thompson. After the game, I heard them talk about the annual Oakwood Ball. Then, I remembered that I was super into Teresa from the class down the hall. Of course, as a gentlephant of my age, I took the liberty to settle for someone who was actually in my league, like Martha.</p>

            <p class="solarparagraph_right solarparagraph_text_align_center">Martha was polite yet adventurous, fun but smart, and all other contrasting positive features. After that mental argument between me and myself, I decided to talk about it to my best friend. The one who I would tell everything, no matter what. Sadly, I had no friend like that, so reached to you. We sat outside the cafeteria, which had salmon as the main dish of the day. You told me about that weird rash on your nose, but I told you it was nothing (turns out it was a massive Rogue infection, more on that next time), the one thing led to the other, and I told you about Martha. You, however, didn't have anyone in mind for the dance, but you were chill about it.</p>

I don't remember her response, but I believe it was something along the lines of "Urm... uhh... yeeaah. Okay, sure." I borrowed Frank the clown's car, rented a fancy suit, and grew some flowers in my back yard, only to give them to my future companion (and potential future wife). It was truly a dream come true for a young Roguehunter like yours truly.</p>

My mother had made tortellini that night, so I was a bit nauseous. But, I took Frank's car, drove it to university and made it to the ball! ...noooottt exactly. Frank's old car isn't supposed to support so heavy objects, even though it holds about twenty clowns every day. So, the poor pachyderm bathed in pink was stuck on the road for a solid sixty minutes, or most commonly known as "an hour".</p>

I rush in to the main room, to see what? My best chance to have children, hanging onto a tall, hunched weirdo with a weird infection on his nose. Then, everything stopped. I saw my own life flash before my trunk. I don't remember much after that, but I do remember having to soak three pillowcases that night. It truly was a night to remember. But not a night to relive.<br>
              I never had forgiven Arch for that unexpected turn of events, but I never had told him about it, and probably never will.
